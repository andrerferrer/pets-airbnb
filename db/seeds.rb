# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# require 'faker'
# puts 'Creating owner'
# owner = User.create!(
#   email: Faker::Internet.email,
#   password: '123456'
#   )

# puts 'Inserting 5 fictitious animals...'
# 5.times do |pet|
#   pet = Pet.create!(
#     name: Faker::Creature::Animal.name,
#     description: Faker::Lorem.sentence,
#     price: Faker::Number.decimal(l_digits: 2),
#     owner: owner
#     )
# end

# puts 'Ended seeding!'
